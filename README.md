This project uses MAVEN. To compile the source code just execute the following command (it also run all the JUnit tests):

mvn install
```

You will get your JAR file into ./target dir. Then launch the http-web-server contained in the JAR like this:

```shell
java -jar HttpWebServer-Proof-of-concept-0.0.1.jar
```

By default the http-web-server accepts request under the 8080 TCP port. Optionally, you can set the TCP server port like this:

```shell
java -jar HttpWebServer-Proof-of-concept-0.0.1.jar 9090
```
